# CraftsCircle
CraftsCircle is an e-commerce platform for buying and selling handmade crafts. It supports two roles: 
Admin (who manages the listings) and Buyer (who browses, purchases, and manages items in a cart). 
The project highlights full-stack skills using React (or HTML, CSS and JS), Node.js/Express, and 
MongoDB, with a clean and responsive design. The aim is to offer a marketplace that values 
creativity, simplicity, and usability.
